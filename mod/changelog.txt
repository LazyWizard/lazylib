 2.3 (October XX, 2018)
========================
Bundled the Kotlin runtime library (v1.3.0) with LazyLib:
 - Kotlin is an alternate JVM language that is 100% interoperable with Java
 - "Core" LazyLib is and always shall be written in Java, though some features
   such as the font classes are written in Kotlin for convenience's sake
 - Kotlin extension methods can be found within the org.lazywizard.lazylib.ext
   package in jars/LazyLib-Kotlin.jar (Java users can safely ignore this jar)
Added @Nullable and @NotNull annotations where appropriate
Added org.lazywizard.lazylib.ui.LazyFont:
 - Represents a bitmap font (the same type Starsector itself uses)
 - Load a font using the static method loadFont(String fontPath)
 - Use createText() to create a reusable DrawableString, which can draw a
   block of text repeatedly and very efficiently
 - Use drawText() to manually draw text into a VBO or display list
 - See LazyFont's javadoc for example usage
Changes to CampaignUtils:
 - Added getEntitiesWithRep(SectorEntityToken token, String entityTag,
   IncludeRep include, RepLevel rep)
 - Added toWorldCoordinates(Vector2f screenCoordinates)
 - Added toScreenCoordinates(Vector2f worldCoordinates)
Changes to CollisionUtils:
 - Added getNearestPointOnBounds(Vector2f source, CombatEntityAPI entity)
Changes to ColorUtils:
 - Added glColor(Color color, float alpha)
Changes to CombatUtils:
 - Added toWorldCoordinates(Vector2f screenCoordinates)
 - Added toScreenCoordinates(Vector2f worldCoordinates)
Changes to FastTrig:
 - Added atan() and atan2() that are much faster (though less accurate)
   than the implementations in Java's core Math class
Changes to MathUtils:
 - Added FPI and FTAU constants, contain Math.PI and Math.PI * 2 as floats
 - Added clamp(float/int toClamp, float/int min, float/int max). This clamps
   the passed value within the given range. Variants are provided for both
   integers and floats.
 - Added getNearestPointOnLine(Vector2f source, Vector2f lineStart,
   Vector2f lineEnd)
 - Added getPoint(Vector2f center, float radius, float angle). This acts as an
   alias for the existing getPointOnCircumference(), which is both the most
   commonly used method in LazyLib as well as one of the most awkwardly named
Changes to ModUtils:
 - Added isModEnabled(String modId)
 - Added loadClassesIfClassIsPresent(String classCanonicalName,
   List<String> classesToLoadCanonicalNames, boolean initializeClasses)
 - Added getEnabledModIds()
 - Added getOverrides(), returns vanilla files explicitly overridden by any
   mod (ie: in that mod's mod_info.sjon 'replace' section)
Changes to VectorUtils:
 - getFacing() and getAngle() now use FastTrig's new atan2() implementation
 - Added getFacingStrict() and getAngleStrict(), which are slower but more
   accurate (these use the old pre-2.3 implementations)
 - Added isZeroVector(Vector2f vector)
 - Added resize(Vector2f vector, float length)
 - Added resize(Vector2f vector, float length, Vector2f dest)
 - Added clampLength(Vector2f vector, float maxLength)
 - Added clampLength(Vector2f vector, float maxLength, Vector2f dest)
 - Added clampLength(Vector2f vector, float minLength, float maxLength)
 - Added clampLength(Vector2f toClamp, float minLength, float maxLength,
   Vector2f dest)
 - Added rotate(Vector2f toRotate, float angle), convenience method that
   stores the result in toRotate
 - Added rotateAroundPivot(Vector2f toRotate, Vector2f pivotPoint,
   float angle), convenience method that stores the result in toRotate
Removed from LazyLib:
 - Removed isDevBuild()
Removed from SimpleEntity:
 - Removed Object constructor (it used reflection, which is now blocked;
   remaining options are Vector2f, WeaponAPI, and ShipEngineAPI)

   sensors of the token passed in to the method
 - Fixed a few getNearbyX() methods potentially including the token they are
   searching around
Changes to CollectionUtils:
 - Added combinedList() and combinedSet() to simplify creating a List/Set from
   multiple source Collections, take any number of Collections as arguments

=======================
Added "enableCaching" to lazylib_settings.json, on by default
Changes to AIUtils:
 - getEnemiesOnMap() will now store the results for faster consecutive calls
   during the same frame if caching is enabled, also affects all other

 - isPointOnSegment() is now only accurate to within 1/3 su,
   use MathUtils.isPointOnLine() if you need strict accuracy
Changes to LazyLib:
 - Added isCachingEnabled()
Changes to WeaponUtils:
 - Fixed an edge case bug with isWithinArc() and entities just outside the arc

Significant JavaDoc expansion, reformatting, and other readability improvements
Deprecated all methods with a sortByDistance parameter
 - Call Collections.sort() using one of CollectionUtils' Comparators instead
Added lazylib_settings.json:
 - "logDeprecated" sets whether to log usage of deprecated LazyLib methods,
   useful for modders since these will eventually be removed from LazyLib
 - "crashOnDeprecated", if true will throw a RuntimeException when a deprecated
   LazyLib method is used (for modders to track down usage via the stacktrace)
Added org.lazywizard.lazylib.opengl.DrawUtils:
 - drawCircle(float centerX, float centerY, float radius, int numSegments)
 - drawArc(float centerX, float centerY, float radius, float startAngle,
   float arcAngle, int numSegments)

   using multiple filters on a Collection at once
 - These methods support generics
Changes to CollisionUtils:
 - Fixed getCollisionPoint() returning null when collision point lies directly
   on the end of a line (this means getCollisionPoint(beam.getFrom(),
   beam.getTo(), beam.getDamageTarget()) actually works again)
 - Fixed getCollides() instantiating a new Line2D object each time it's called
Changes to CombatUtils:
 - No longer implements EveryFrameCombatPlugin (also removed LazyLibCombatHook)

Changes to FleetUtils:
 - Fixed null pointer exception when using these methods in hyperspace
 - Added getRelation(CampaignFleetAPI fleet1, CampaignFleetAPI fleet2)

 - Deprecated getDirectionalVector(CombatEntityAPI source,
   CombatEntityAPI destination)
Deprecated in WeaponUtils:
 - Deprecated getEnemiesInArc(WeaponAPI weapon, boolean sortByDistance)
 - Deprecated getEnemyMissilesInArc(WeaponAPI weapon, boolean sortByDistance)

Changes to CollisionUtils:
 - Added isPointOnSegment(Vector2f point, SegmentAPI segment)
Changes to LazyLib:
 - Added getLogLevel(), returns logger level used by all LazyLib classes
 - setLogLevel() now includes AnchoredEntity and SimpleEntity as well

 1.6 (September 27, 2013)
==========================
Updated the codebase to use the new .6a methods
Deprecated several methods whose functionality is now included within the API
Usage of deprecated methods is now reported in starsector.log if devMode=true
Changes to AIUtils:
 - All methods now only return entities that are visible on the battle map.
   Note: this change may alter the behavior of existing scripts!
   (use CombatUtils if you wish to find ships regardless of fog of war coverage)
 - Changed canUseSystemThisFrame() so it only returns true when the system can
   be toggled (essentially checks if the 'use system' key would do anything).
   This was the intended behavior of this method, but some old scripts might
   rely on the old, broken behavior and need to be changed.
Changes to CollectionUtils:
 - SortXByDistance constructors now have an optional includeRadius parameter
   that sets if collision/interaction radius is considered (defaults to true)
 - implode() now works with any Collection, not just one containing Strings
 - Deprecated CollectionUtils.SortObjectivesByDistance as BattleObjectiveAPI
   now extends CombatEntityAPI (use SortEntitiesByDistance instead)
 - Deprecated weightedRandom(Map pickFrom) in favor of
   com.fs.starfarer.api.util.WeightedRandomPicker
 - Deprecated weightedRandom(Map pickFrom, int numToPick) in favor of
   com.fs.starfarer.api.util.WeightedRandomPicker (call pick() multiple times)
Changes to CombatUtils:
 - Deprecated getCombatEngine() in favor of Global.getCombatEngine()
 - Deprecated getElapsedCombatTime() in favor of
   CombatEngineAPI,getTotalElapsedTime()
 - Deprecated getElapsedCombatTimeIncludingPaused() in favor of
   CombatEngineAPI,getTotalElapsedTime()
 - Deprecated getTimeSinceLastFrame() in favor of
   CombatEngineAPI.getElapsedInLastFrame()
Changes to DefenseUtils:
 - Deprecated getArmorCellAtWorldCoord(ShipAPI ship, Vector2f loc)
   in favor of ArmorGridAPI.getCellAtLocation(Vector2f loc)
Changes to LazyLib:
 - Now logs the current LazyLib version on game load
 - Added setLogLevel(Level level), sets the log level for all utility classes
   (defaults to Level.DEBUG for dev builds, Level.ERROR for main releases)
Changes to MathUtils:
 - Added getRandomPointOnLine(Vector2f lineStart, Vector2f lineEnd)
 - Added isPointOnLine(Vector2f point, Vector2f lineStart, Vector2f lineEnd)
 - The various getDistance() methods involving SectorEntityTokens now
   take interaction radius into account. Note: this change may alter the
   behavior of existing scripts!
 - getDistanceSquared() methods incorporating a radius are no longer marked
   as deprecated, instead the documentation includes a warning that using
   getDistance() may be just as efficient
Changes to WeaponUtils:
 - Fixed inaccuracies with getTimeToAim(), but method doesn't take ship
   turn speed into account anymore
 - All calculateDamage() methods are now marked as deprecated. There are just
   too many factors going into damage for this to be testable (26 MutableStats
   that affect damage dealt/taken as of .6a, let alone armor damage reduction).

   id matches this ship (or null if no match was found)
Changes to MathUtils:
 - Added equals(float a, float b), tests for 99.99999+% equality of floats

   DefenseType defense)
 - These methods are not 100% accurate yet, still tracking down some oddities

 1.4 (May 06, 2013)
====================
Added @since annotations (useful for finding the lowest library version needed)
Miscellaneous other JavaDoc improvements
Minor math optimizations related to the changes made in the 1.3 update
Added SimpleEntity class (barebones implementation of CombatEntityAPI):
 - Useful for spawnEmpArc(), which can target a CombatEntityAPI
 - Has a constructor that takes a Vector2f, for a static location
 - Can also take an Object that has a getLocation() method, for mobile targets
   (useful for targeting a specific WeaponAPI). This uses reflection!
Changes to CombatUtils:
 - Added getTimeSinceLastFrame()
Changes to MathUtils:
 - Circle-based methods support a null center point (acts as a 0, 0 origin)
 - Added getRandomNumberInRange(float min, float max)
 - Added getEquidistantPointsInsideCircle(Vector2f center, float radius,
   float spaceBetweenPoints)
Changes to CollisionUtils:
 - Made isPointWithinBounds() more efficient
 - Added isPointWithinCollisionCircle(Vector2f point, CombatEntityAPI entity)
Changes to AIUtils:
 - Added getEnemyMissilesOnMap(CombatEntityAPI entity, [boolean sortByDistance])
 - Added getNearbyEnemyMissiles(CombatEntityAPI entity, float range,
   [boolean sortByDistance])
 - Added getNearestMissile(CombatEntityAPI entity)
 - Added getNearestEnemyMissile(CombatEntityAPI entity)
Changes to WeaponUtils:
 - Added getEnemiesInArc(WeaponAPI weapon, [boolean sortByDistance])
 - Added getNearestEnemyInArc(WeaponAPI weapon)
 - Added getEnemyMissilesInArc(WeaponAPI weapon, [boolean sortByDistance])
 - Added getNearestEnemyMissileInArc(WeaponAPI weapon)
 - Added aimTowardsPoint(WeaponAPI weapon, Vector2f point, float time)
(method parameters in [brackets] signify optional parameters)


 1.3 (April 10, 2013)
======================
MathUtil's getDistance() methods now include collision radius, if applicable
Note: this change may alter the behavior of existing scripts!
Use the getDistance() methods that take two Vector2f for the old behavior

 1.2 (March 20, 2013)
======================
Greatly expanded FleetUtils (equivalent to AIUtils but for CampaignFleetAPIs)
Added clampAngle() to MathUtils (normalizes angle between 0 and 360 degrees)
Added applyForce() to CombatUtils (basic implementation of Newton's Second Law)
Removed DefenseType and Line classes for now (unused internal data types)

 1.1 (February 27, 2013)
=========================
Added LazyLib class to org.lazywizard.lazylib (contains version information)
Added a few missing JavaDoc entries and updated others for clarity
All getWithinRange() methods now have an optional sort-by-distance parameter
Added Comparators to CollectionUtils for sorting by distance from a Vector
 - SortEntitiesByDistance(Vector2f location): sorts CombatEntityAPIs
 - SortTokensByDistance(Vector2f location): sorts SectorEntityTokens
 - SortObjectivesByDistance(Vector2f location): sorts BattleObjectiveAPIs

 1.0 (February 23, 2013)
=========================
Initial utility mod release, contains 12 classes and 62 methods.
Added JavaDoc (included with mod download)
Changes from bundled jar version:
 - Removed Slick2D classes (save FastTrig)
 - Added CollisionUtils class (bounds checking and collision detection)
 - Rewrote WeaponUtils to use the new CollisionUtils instead of Slick2D
 - Moved FastTrig from org.lazywizard.lazylib.geom to org.lazywizard.lazylib
 - Fixed several bugs (including a broken getRandomPointInCircle())
 - Slight optimization of math-heavy methods
