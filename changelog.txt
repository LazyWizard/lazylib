 1.3 (April 10, 2013)
======================
MathUtil's getDistance() methods now include collision radius, if applicable
Note: this change may alter the behavior of existing scripts!

 1.2 (March 20, 2013)
======================
Greatly expanded FleetUtils (equivalent to AIUtils but for CampaignFleetAPIs)
Added clampAngle() to MathUtils (normalizes angle between 0 and 360 degrees)
Added applyForce() to CombatUtils (basic implementation of Newton's Second Law)
Removed DefenseType and Line classes for now (unused internal data types)

 1.1 (February 27, 2013)
=========================
Added LazyLib class to org.lazywizard.lazylib (contains version information)
Added a few missing JavaDoc entries and updated others for clarity
All getWithinRange() methods now have an optional sort-by-distance parameter
Added Comparators to CollectionUtils for sorting by distance from a Vector
 - SortEntitiesByDistance(Vector2f location): sorts CombatEntityAPIs
 - SortTokensByDistance(Vector2f location): sorts SectorEntityTokens
 - SortObjectivesByDistance(Vector2f location): sorts BattleObjectiveAPIs

 1.0 (February 23, 2013)
=========================
Initial utility mod release, contains 12 classes and 62 methods.
Added JavaDoc (included with mod download)
Changes from bundled jar version:
 - Removed Slick2D classes (save FastTrig)
 - Added CollisionUtils class (bounds checking and collision detection)
 - Rewrote WeaponUtils to use the new CollisionUtils instead of Slick2D
 - Moved FastTrig from org.lazywizard.lazylib.geom to org.lazywizard.lazylib
 - Fixed several bugs (including a broken getRandomPointInCircle())
 - Slight optimization of math-heavy methods
